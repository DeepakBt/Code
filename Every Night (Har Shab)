Every Night

Every night my heart sits in front of your picture
I know there is no way but loneliness
My world turning into a dark world
My heart is dying
because I thought you were here
My every night crying is my loneliness habit
your love in my heart
causing scandal
oh of loneliness
my crazy heart still loves you
night and door and wall are friends of my crying
oh of loneliness
maybe
you forgot me
I can not carry on anymore
but still my heart
is not going to be calm
I'm lonely
your grief again
comes to my heart
Although you have gone
but it(your grief) will be here forever
every people seeing me and say that he's so depressed
it's your eyes fault
not my heart
oh of loneliness
I'm so tired,I don't tolerate
I wish you know
I still love you
You are my World.
