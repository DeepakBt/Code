As a programmer you have incredible power. 
You can build something from nothing. 
You are like God. 
You can change the world. 
You can build something that will change the world.

Component: An individual software component is a software package, a web service, 
a web resource, or a module that encapsulates a set of related functions (or data).

components communicate with each other via interfaces. 
When a component offers services to the rest of the system, 
it adopts a provided interface that specifies the services that other components can utilize, and how they can do so. 
This interface can be seen as a signature of the component â€“ the client does not need to know about 
the inner workings of the component (implementation) in order to make use of it. 
This principle results in components referred to as encapsulated.

A component is a small, potentially re-usable set of logic, behaviors and interface elements (UI or API). 
And without components or component-based UI development, 
our applications become monolithic spaghetti monsters and nightmares.
